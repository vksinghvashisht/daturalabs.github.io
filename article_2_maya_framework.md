# The Maya Framework: How I Screen Investments for Illusion

**By VK Singh Vashisht | Datura Labs**

Maya is a Sanskrit concept that does not translate cleanly into English. The closest approximation is "illusion" — but that undersells it. Maya is not merely a false perception. It is the appearance of value where no enduring value exists. It is the attractive surface that conceals an empty interior. In the Yogic tradition, maya is the primary obstacle to clear vision.

I have been studying Sanskrit philosophy for years. At some point, the concept started appearing everywhere I looked in investment contexts — not as metaphor, but as diagnosis.

Every deal pipeline is full of maya. Opportunities that look like value plays but are actually political risk dressed as yield. Distressed assets that appear cheap because the distress is structural, not cyclical. Emerging verticals with compelling narrative and no operational reality. The appearance of opportunity is everywhere. The substance is far rarer.

The Maya Framework is my systematic attempt to distinguish between them.

## What the Framework Does

The Maya Framework is an investment screening system. It sits at the front of every deal evaluation process at Datura Labs. Before I spend time underwriting a deal, conducting due diligence, or engaging advisors, every opportunity passes through a standardized screen that routes it to one of three outcomes:

**PURSUE** — The opportunity clears all screening criteria. Full underwriting begins.

**WATCH** — The opportunity has merit but fails one or more current criteria. It enters a monitoring queue for future re-evaluation.

**PASS** — The opportunity fails screening. No further time investment.

The framework is not meant to find the best deals. It is meant to eliminate the maya — the category of opportunities that look compelling but will consume time, capital, and attention without producing returns. The failure mode I am designing against is not missing a good deal. It is spending six months on a deal that should have been passed in the first conversation.

## The Four Screening Dimensions

### 1. Capital Requirements

My current investment mandate focuses on opportunities under $5 million in total capital deployment. This is not a permanent constraint — it reflects the current phase of building a distressed asset portfolio while operating lean, without institutional capital partners who would impose their own timeline and governance requirements.

Any opportunity requiring more than $5 million in total capital is automatically WATCH or PASS depending on its other characteristics. This single criterion eliminates a significant percentage of deal flow without further analysis.

The maya this screens for: deals that look accessible but require capital structures — preferred equity, institutional co-investors, bridge financing — that either don't exist at current scale or would compromise operational control.

### 2. Timeline

Every deal I evaluate must have a clear path to liquidity or cash flow within 18 months. Not a projected timeline — a structural one. The exit mechanism should be visible from the moment of entry.

This eliminates an entire category of speculative investments that carry compelling narratives about future value but no mechanism for capturing it on a defined timeline. It also screens out deals where the exit depends on market conditions that cannot be controlled or predicted.

The maya this screens for: opportunities where the "value" is entirely prospective, dependent on market timing, regulatory approval, or conditions that are not structurally guaranteed.

### 3. Political and Regulatory Risk

Every opportunity is scored on a two-axis political risk matrix. The first axis measures the degree to which returns depend on political decisions — zoning changes, regulatory approvals, government contracts, policy continuity. The second axis measures the complexity of the regulatory environment and the timeline for resolution.

High scores on either axis are disqualifying unless offset by extraordinarily favorable economics on every other dimension.

This screening dimension was developed directly from observing patterns in distressed real estate, energy assets, and emerging technology — three verticals where political risk is systematically underpriced by deal sponsors and systematically devastating to investors who don't account for it.

The maya this screens for: opportunities where the investment thesis depends on a political or regulatory outcome that is outside the investor's control and subject to reversal.

### 4. Operational Clarity

Can I describe, in two sentences, exactly what happens operationally from acquisition to exit? If the answer requires caveats, conditional logic, or the phrase "it depends," the deal fails this dimension.

This is the most subjective of the four dimensions and the most important. It is designed to catch deals that are complex not because they require sophisticated execution but because the complexity conceals an absence of genuine value.

The maya this screens for: deals where the business model is unclear, where multiple parties have competing claims on returns, where the path from entry to exit requires conditions that are unstated or assumed.

## How PURSUE / WATCH / PASS Works in Practice

A deal enters the pipeline from any of several sources: Perplexity Spaces running scheduled intelligence tasks, direct broker relationships, legal proceedings databases, or proprietary deal flow from advisor relationships.

The first pass through the Maya Framework takes approximately fifteen minutes. I am looking for immediate disqualifiers — capital requirements above threshold, no visible exit mechanism, regulatory dependency, operational opacity. Most deals fail at this stage. They go to PASS.

Deals that survive the first pass move to enrichment. Additional research is conducted to fill information gaps on whichever dimensions returned incomplete data. After enrichment, the deal is re-scored. Deals that clear all four dimensions at the enrichment stage move to PURSUE. Deals that clear most dimensions but fail one or two that may change over time move to WATCH.

WATCH is not a holding area for deals I hope will improve. It is a structured monitoring queue. Each WATCH deal has a specific trigger defined: the condition that, if it changes, would move the deal to PURSUE. Without a defined trigger, WATCH becomes a graveyard for indecision — itself a form of maya.

## The Philosophical Foundation

Maya in the Sanskrit tradition is not simply about wrong information. It is about the seduction of appearances. The attractive surface that substitutes for genuine inquiry.

In investment contexts, the seductive surface takes several forms. It is the compelling narrative without operational substance. It is the projected return that obscures structural risk. It is the brand-name advisor relationship that substitutes for genuine fiduciary alignment (a mistake I made for eight years with Goldman Sachs). It is the deal that sounds sophisticated without being sound.

The framework is named for maya not because every failed investment is an illusion, but because the consistent failure mode in investment evaluation is the substitution of appearance for substance. Viveka — discernment — is the Sanskrit antidote to maya. The Maya Framework is an operationalized attempt to build discernment into a repeatable system.

## What the Framework Is Not

The Maya Framework is not a valuation model. It does not produce a price or a return projection. It is a screening system that determines whether full underwriting is warranted — nothing more.

It is not a guarantee against loss. Deals that clear all four dimensions can still fail for reasons that no screening system would catch: execution failures, macroeconomic shifts, counterparty problems.

It is not a static system. The four dimensions and their scoring criteria are reviewed and updated based on portfolio experience. The current version reflects what I have learned about where maya concentrates in the deal categories I evaluate: distressed commercial real estate, fire zone residential lots, oil and gas assets in late-stage fields, and LA corridor multifamily.

## Integration with the Datura Labs Pipeline

The Maya Framework operates as the intake filter for a fully automated deal flow pipeline. Perplexity Spaces run scheduled searches across multiple verticals — CMBS special servicing lists, fire zone permit applications, county distress records, energy asset bankruptcy filings. Findings are formatted and delivered via automated email to a processing queue.

Claude evaluates each incoming signal against the Maya Framework criteria and produces a structured routing recommendation. Deals that receive a PURSUE recommendation move to an Investment Committee memo template. WATCH deals enter the monitoring database with defined triggers. PASS deals are logged and closed.

The automation means I am not personally reviewing every signal that enters the pipeline. The Maya Framework criteria are encoded into the evaluation prompt. The system surfaces what warrants human attention.

This is what "AI-native" actually means in practice: not a chatbot that helps you draft emails, but a structured intelligence layer that operationalizes your decision framework at a scale and consistency that human review alone cannot maintain.

## A Note on Dharmic Capitalism

The Maya Framework sits within a broader investment philosophy I call dharmic capitalism. The term requires its own treatment — and will receive it in a separate essay — but the relevant point here is this: the framework is not only a practical screening tool. It reflects a conviction that the quality of capital allocation decisions depends on the clarity with which an investor sees, and that building systematic screens against illusion is itself a form of right action.

Dharma, in the Sanskrit tradition, is right action aligned with one's nature and role. For a trustee managing trust assets, right action means deploying capital only where genuine value exists — not where the appearance of value is sufficient, not where the narrative is compelling enough to carry the deal past rigorous scrutiny.

The Maya Framework is my operational answer to the question: how do I practice viveka — discernment — systematically, at scale, without substituting my own wishful thinking for clear analysis?
