    <article class="prose">

      <p>There is a particular kind of investor who shows up in distressed markets during the first six months after a dislocation event. They have heard about the opportunity. They have read the thesis. They have attended the conference where someone smart made the case compellingly. They arrive with capital and conviction and a timeline that is, quietly, too short.</p>

      <p>They are tourists.</p>

      <p>Tourism in distressed investing looks like genuine participation until the timeline extends. The property that was supposed to close in sixty days doesn't close in ninety. The permit that was supposed to come through in Q2 moves to Q4. The buyer who was supposed to be there when you were ready to exit is in a different market cycle. And the tourist, whose capital had a job to do by a specific date, makes a decision that the real capital — the patient capital — does not have to make. They sell. They exit at the wrong price, at the wrong time, to the patient capital that was waiting for exactly this moment.</p>

      <p>Distressed investing is not a strategy. It is a discipline. And the discipline is patience, applied systematically, in contexts where most capital cannot afford to be patient.</p>

      <h2>Why Institutions Cannot Do This</h2>

      <p>The structural reason family offices can operate in distressed markets more effectively than institutions is not that family offices are smarter. It is that family offices have a different relationship to time.</p>

      <p>An institutional fund has a life — typically seven to ten years — and within that life it has a deployment schedule, an investor reporting cycle, and a carried interest structure that creates incentives to mark assets and manage optics on a quarterly basis. An institutional fund manager who is sitting on a distressed property in month thirty-six of a fifty-four month hold, watching the carry accrue theoretical losses while waiting for a regulatory process to resolve, is not in a structurally comfortable position. The LP letters are not comfortable. The quarterly calls are not comfortable. The institutional reluctance to enter distressed positions with long regulatory tails is not irrationality — it is a rational response to the incentive structure of institutional capital.</p>

      <p>Family office capital does not have a fund life. It does not have a deployment schedule imposed by outside LPs. It does not have a quarterly reporting cycle that requires marking positions to market for an audience that will draw the wrong conclusion. When I am sitting on a fire zone lot in month eighteen of a thirty-month hold, waiting for a city planning process to resolve, I do not have to explain this to anyone. The capital has one job: be in the right place at the right price when the value event occurs.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Institutional reluctance is not risk. It is the entry point.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What the Institutional Reluctance Premium Actually Is</h2>

      <p>In efficient markets, risk and return are supposed to be correlated. Assets that carry more risk should, in theory, price at a discount that compensates holders for bearing that risk. This is true in liquid, well-understood markets where participants can accurately price the risk they are bearing.</p>

      <p>In distressed markets, something different happens. Assets trade at a discount that is not purely a function of their underlying risk — it is a function of who is able to hold them. An asset that requires a thirty-month hold to reach value realization is not thirty months worth of risk. It is thirty months of illiquidity, regulatory uncertainty, and carrying cost. Institutional capital, which cannot comfortably hold illiquid assets with uncertain timelines on its books, prices this discount as if the underlying business were impaired. Often, the business is not impaired. The holders are.</p>

      <p>This is the institutional reluctance premium — the excess discount applied to assets that are structurally difficult for the dominant capital in the market to hold, regardless of the underlying value. It is not a risk premium. It is a structural inefficiency created by the mismatch between asset characteristics and the capital structures of the dominant market participants.</p>

      <p>Family office capital — patient, flexible, not subject to external reporting cycles — can harvest this premium systematically. The strategy is not to find better assets. It is to find the same assets that institutional capital has already evaluated and passed on, and to ask whether the pass was based on asset quality or on holder capability. When the answer is holder capability, the entry price is wrong and the opportunity is real.</p>

      <h2>What This Looks Like in Practice</h2>

      <p>In the current environment, I am looking at three categories of assets where the institutional reluctance premium is most pronounced.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire zone lots in Southern California.</strong> Post-Palisades and Altadena, there is a significant inventory of lots trading at distressed prices — insurance settlement values, motivated sellers, clear title in most cases. Institutional capital will not touch these because the entitlement timeline is uncertain, the insurance market for rebuild is dislocated, and the regulatory environment for fire zone construction is in flux. All of these concerns are real. None of them are fatal to a patient holder with the diligence capability to underwrite the regulatory risk accurately. The market is pricing these assets as if the concerns were fatal. They are not.</p>

      <p><strong>CMBS special servicing situations.</strong> Commercial real estate loans in special servicing are trading at significant discounts to par. The institutional buyers who would normally clear this market — distressed debt funds, CMBS resolution specialists — are dealing with their own capital constraints and existing portfolio pressures. The bid-ask spread is wide, and the wide spread is creating opportunities to acquire at prices that reflect the seller's need for liquidity rather than the asset's underlying value. The work is in the diligence: understanding the property, the loan structure, the workout options, and the realistic timeline to resolution.</p>

      <p><strong>363 oil and gas assets.</strong> Companies in bankruptcy with producing oil and gas assets are selling those assets through court-supervised auction processes. The universe of buyers in these auctions is smaller than it should be — energy-focused private equity has its own constraints, and the assets are often too small for large operators to bother with. Small, producing assets in good basins with clear operating plans can be acquired at prices that reflect the bankruptcy context rather than the production economics.</p>

      <h2>The Discipline That Makes It Work</h2>

      <p>The institutional reluctance premium exists because these assets are genuinely difficult to hold. Patient capital does not mean passive capital. It means capital that has done the work to understand exactly what it is holding and why, and that can therefore remain comfortable through the periods when an underprepared holder would be uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>This is where the Maya Framework earns its keep. Every distressed position I evaluate gets screened for the sources of actual risk — not the sources of institutional reluctance, which are mostly about timeline and liquidity — but the sources of genuine impairment. Is the underlying asset actually broken, or is it just difficult to hold? That distinction is the entire job.</p>

      <p>Distressed capital done well is not clever. It is not about finding hidden information or outsmarting sophisticated market participants. It is about having the structural capability to hold assets through the periods when others cannot, and the analytical discipline to know, before you enter, exactly what you are holding and why the timeline will resolve in your favor.</p>

      <p>The tourists find out they are tourists when the timeline extends. The patient capital was ready for that the day it entered the position.</p>
