    <article class="prose">

      <p>Every family office conference I attend has the same conversation happening in the hallways. Someone has deployed an AI tool — a deal flow dashboard, a portfolio monitoring product, an automated reporting layer. They are pleased with it. It saves time. The interface is clean. The vendor was credible. The demo was impressive.</p>

      <p>And then nothing compounds. The tool does what it did on day one. The family office is slightly more efficient at the margin, and slightly more dependent on a vendor whose interests are not perfectly aligned with theirs, and slightly further from building the kind of institutional intelligence that actually creates durable advantage.</p>

      <p>This is the pattern I see across the family office world right now: the application of AI at the surface level, in ways that produce visible efficiency gains and invisible strategic stagnation. Buying dashboards instead of building infrastructure. Renting intelligence instead of accumulating it.</p>

      <h2>The SaaS Fee Trap, Restated</h2>

      <p>I wrote about this dynamic in the context of Goldman Sachs — the tendency of institutional service relationships to charge premium fees for the appearance of sophistication while obscuring the actual cost. The same dynamic is now operating in the family office AI market.</p>

      <p>The pitch is always the same: our platform uses AI to give you insights you couldn't generate yourself, at a price that is a fraction of what it would cost to build. The math looks compelling in the demo. It looks different when you account for the full cost over a five-year relationship: subscription fees that increase annually, data portability limitations that make switching expensive, and the compounding opportunity cost of not having built the capability internally while the window was open.</p>

      <p>The family offices that will look most capable in five years are the ones building directly on frontier models today — not because the frontier models are ready for everything, but because the organizational capability to use them effectively compounds in exactly the same way that financial capital compounds. Every year you spend building, you get better at building. Every year you spend subscribing, you get better at subscribing.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Every year you spend building, you get better at building. Every year you spend subscribing, you get better at subscribing.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What Building Actually Looks Like</h2>

      <p>I want to be specific about this, because "build vs. buy" is a conversation that often stays abstract. Here is what building looks like in practice, in the context of a family office at the scale I operate:</p>

      <p><strong>Deal flow intelligence.</strong> Instead of a paid deal flow platform, I use Perplexity's API with scheduled search agents running across specific markets — fire zone properties in Los Angeles, 363 sale oil and gas assets in producing basins, CMBS special servicing lists in target markets. These agents run on a schedule, format their output, and deliver it to an email inbox. The total cost is a fraction of any comparable platform. The customization is complete. The data belongs to me.</p>

      <p><strong>Investment screening.</strong> Instead of a scoring platform, I built the Maya Framework screening system directly in Claude. Every deal that arrives in the pipeline gets run through the same five-question evaluation. The output is structured, archived, and searchable. Over time, I am building an institutional memory of every deal I have ever evaluated — why I passed, what the thesis was, what happened. No vendor provides this. No dashboard captures it. It compounds because I own it.</p>

      <p><strong>Document analysis.</strong> Offering memoranda, financials, environmental reports, title documents. All of this gets processed through frontier models with prompts I have refined over hundreds of documents. My prompts are better than they were six months ago because I have been refining them for six months. A vendor's prompts are also being refined — but they are being refined to serve their entire customer base, not my specific diligence patterns.</p>

      <p><strong>Relationship intelligence.</strong> Every contact I meet, every conversation I have, every conference I attend generates structured notes that feed a contact database. When I am preparing for a meeting, I have full context on every previous interaction with that person, every deal we discussed, every commitment they made. This is not a CRM feature. It is institutional memory that compounds with every interaction.</p>

      <h2>The Structural Advantage No One Is Talking About</h2>

      <p>Family offices have one structural advantage in the AI transition that institutions do not: decision-making speed. A family office can decide to build something on Monday and deploy it on Friday. An institution has to go through procurement, compliance review, vendor evaluation, and approval processes that take months. By the time an institution deploys a new AI capability, a well-run family office has already had six months of experience using it, refining it, and building on top of it.</p>

      <p>This is the window. It is not permanent. As AI tools become more commoditized, the advantage of speed will diminish. What will remain is the advantage of institutional knowledge — the accumulated experience of using these tools, the refined prompts, the structured data, the organizational capability — that cannot be purchased from a vendor because it was built by using the tools yourself, over time, in the specific context of your specific operation.</p>

      <p>The family offices that spend the next two years building will have institutional knowledge that cannot be acquired. The ones that spend the next two years subscribing will have vendor relationships that can be acquired by anyone willing to pay the same subscription fee.</p>

      <h2>Where to Start</h2>

      <p>The most common objection I hear from family office principals is capability. They do not have engineers. They do not know how to build. They are not technical. This is true, and it used to matter more than it does now. Modern frontier models make a remarkable amount of capability accessible to people who are willing to learn to use them well, without writing code in the traditional sense.</p>

      <p>The starting point is not infrastructure. It is one problem. Pick the most time-consuming analytical task in your operation — the one where your team spends the most hours doing work that should be automatable. Build a solution for that single problem using a frontier model directly. Do not purchase a platform. Do not hire a consultant. Sit with the tool and build something that works for your specific situation.</p>

      <p>You will spend more time than you expect and get something worse than a polished vendor product. You will also understand something that no vendor demo will ever teach you: what it actually feels like to build institutional intelligence rather than rent it. That understanding is the beginning of the compounding advantage.</p>

      <p>The window is open. Most of the family offices in your peer group are still in the conference hallway, talking about the dashboard someone deployed. The ones who figure out how to build while everyone else is talking will look, in five years, like they had some kind of unfair advantage.</p>

      <p>They did. It was just time.</p>
