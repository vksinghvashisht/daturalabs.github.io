Family offices with patient capital and genuine diligence capability can operate in this gap."

          "text": "When a home is destroyed in a wildfire, the property owner receives an insurance settlement for the structure but retains the land. Many owners — particularly those who are older, who rented, or who decide not to rebuild — become motivated sellers of the underlying lot. These lots often trade at significant discounts to their pre-fire land value because the buyer universe is thin: institutional capital won't touch them, and most retail buyers lack the diligence capability to underwrite the entitlement and rebuild timeline accurately. The discount is a function of who can hold the asset, not of the asset's underlying value."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The primary risks in fire zone property investment are: entitlement timeline uncertainty (city planning departments move on their own schedule, not the investor's), insurance availability for rebuild (the California insurance market is dislocated and coverage for fire zone construction is constrained), regulatory changes to fire zone building codes (which can increase rebuild costs materially), and liquidity risk if the expected buyer pool for rebuilt properties does not materialize. Patient capital with accurate underwriting of these specific risks can evaluate whether the pricing adequately compensates for them. Most of the pricing discount in current fire zone lots reflects institutional inability to hold rather than actual impairment of value."

    <article class="prose">

      <p>The Palisades fire burned through approximately 23,000 acres of some of the most expensive real estate on the planet. The Altadena fire burned through a different kind of neighborhood — less famous, less photographed, but no less consequential for the families who lost everything and the market that is now trying to price what remains.</p>

      <p>In the months since, most of the commentary has focused on the insurance crisis, the regulatory response, and the question of whether Los Angeles can rebuild. These are real questions and they deserve serious attention. But there is a parallel conversation that is not yet happening publicly, among the category of investors who are positioned to act on it: the question of what the pricing dislocation in fire zone lots actually represents, and whether it compensates patient capital adequately for the risks it asks patient capital to bear.</p>

      <p>My answer, having spent significant time evaluating specific assets in both affected areas, is that the pricing in most cases is wrong — and wrong in the direction that creates opportunity for the right kind of capital.</p>

      <h2>How Insurance Settlements Create the Opportunity</h2>

      <p>When a home is destroyed in a wildfire, the insurance settlement covers the structure. It does not cover the land. The owner retains title to the lot — often a lot in a neighborhood that, before the fire, was worth substantially more than the insurance policy on the structure would suggest.</p>

      <p>This creates a category of motivated seller that is not purely financial. Many of the sellers in the current Palisades and Altadena lot market are selling because the rebuild process — managing contractors, navigating permits, dealing with insurance adjusters, fighting with the city over setback requirements for fireproof construction — is simply more than they have the capacity to undertake. They are not selling because the land has no value. They are selling because the land's value is locked behind a process they cannot execute.</p>

      <p>The buyer who can execute that process — who has the diligence capability to underwrite the entitlement timeline accurately, the financial structure to carry the asset through the regulatory process, and the operational relationships to navigate the rebuild — can acquire these lots at prices that reflect the seller's process constraints rather than the land's underlying value.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>They are not selling because the land has no value. They are selling because the land's value is locked behind a process they cannot execute.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What the Institutional Buyers Are Telling You by Not Showing Up</h2>

      <p>The institutional buyers who would normally provide price support in a real estate dislocation of this magnitude — the REITs, the private equity real estate funds, the large family offices with dedicated real estate teams — are largely absent from the fire zone lot market. This absence is being interpreted by some as a signal that the opportunity is not real. I read it differently.</p>

      <p>Institutional capital has constraints that are not functions of underlying asset quality. A REIT cannot hold a portfolio of distressed lots with uncertain entitlement timelines on its balance sheet without triggering investor concerns about asset quality. A private equity real estate fund with a seven-year life cannot underwrite a position where the value event might take four years to materialize — the carry economics don't work. A large family office with a dedicated real estate team has a deal size minimum that most individual fire zone lots don't meet.</p>

      <p>None of these constraints are about the lots themselves. They are about the capital structures of the buyers. The institutional absence is not a signal that the lots are uninvestable. It is a signal that the lots are uninvestable for institutional capital — which is precisely what creates the pricing opportunity for family office capital that does not share these constraints.</p>

      <h2>The Actual Risks, Stated Clearly</h2>

      <p>I am not arguing that fire zone lots are without risk. They carry specific, real risks that have to be underwritten accurately or the thesis does not hold. Being honest about these is the job.</p>

      <p><strong>Entitlement timeline risk.</strong> The City of Los Angeles planning department operates on its own schedule. Permits for new construction in fire zones — particularly under the new fire-hardened building code requirements that are still being finalized — take longer than the optimistic pro forma suggests. I underwrite eighteen to thirty months for entitlement, not twelve. The difference in carrying cost between these timelines is material and has to be in the underwriting from day one.</p>

      <p><strong>Insurance market risk.</strong> The California insurance market for fire zone properties is genuinely dislocated. Major carriers have exited the market or dramatically restricted coverage. FAIR Plan availability is limited and expensive. Any underwriting of a fire zone acquisition that does not include a specific, credible plan for construction and permanent insurance coverage is incomplete. This is not a theoretical risk — it is a condition on the exit that has to be solved before you enter.</p>

      <p><strong>Building code evolution risk.</strong> The regulatory environment for fire zone construction in California is actively changing. New requirements for fire-resistant materials, defensible space, and construction methods are being finalized in the aftermath of the Palisades and Altadena fires. These requirements will increase rebuild costs relative to pre-fire construction costs. Any underwriting that uses pre-fire construction cost estimates is using the wrong number.</p>

      <p><strong>Exit market risk.</strong> The thesis only works if there are buyers for rebuilt properties in these neighborhoods at prices that justify the total investment. The Palisades has structural demand support — the location quality is exceptional and the pre-fire demand was deep. Altadena is a more nuanced story, with different income demographics and different rebuild economics. These markets have to be underwritten separately, not as a category.</p>

      <h2>What the Maya Framework Says About This</h2>

      <p>When I run fire zone lot acquisitions through the Maya Framework's five questions, the results are deal-specific but the pattern is consistent. Most lots clear the capital requirement screen — individual lots in the Palisades are typically in the $1-3M range, well within the $5M threshold. The timeline screen requires honest underwriting, not optimistic underwriting — but deals structured with the right timeline assumptions can clear it. The political risk screen is where institutional capital fails: they cannot underwrite the city planning and regulatory uncertainty because their investors will not accept it. Patient capital that has done the regulatory research can underwrite it accurately. The exit screen is the most important and requires the most specificity — but the demand fundamentals in the Palisades support a clear exit thesis for rebuilt product.</p>

      <p>The deals that clear all five questions are real. They are not abundant — the market has enough participants to price away the obvious opportunities — but they exist for buyers willing to do the work that institutional capital is not structured to do.</p>

      <h2>The Conversation That Is Not Happening Yet</h2>

      <p>In six to twelve months, the conversation about fire zone arbitrage will be happening everywhere. The family offices and smaller operators who moved early will have established positions. The institutional capital that couldn't act in the dislocation will be evaluating the secondary market for already-entitled lots or already-rebuilt properties, at prices that reflect the full recovery rather than the distressed entry.</p>

      <p>This is always how the cycle works. The window for patient capital to enter at distressed prices is not permanent. It is the window between the dislocation event and the moment when the path to recovery becomes sufficiently clear that institutional capital can underwrite it. That window is open right now in the Palisades and Altadena markets. It will not be open indefinitely.</p>

      <p>The question is not whether the opportunity is real. The question is whether you have the capital structure, the diligence capability, and the patience to hold through the process that converts a distressed lot into a recovered asset. That question is answered before you look at the first deal — not after.</p>
