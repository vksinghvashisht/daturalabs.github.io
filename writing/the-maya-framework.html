Applied to investing, maya describes opportunities that have the aesthetics of value creation — the pitch deck, the market size, the momentum — but do not survive a rigorous accounting of capital, time, risk, and exit. Most institutional deal flow is maya. The Maya Framework is a systematic tool for identifying it before capital is deployed."

(4) What is the regulatory complexity — how many approval layers, permits, or compliance obligations stand between entry and exit? (5) What is the exit — is there a clear, concrete path to liquidity that does not depend on a future buyer believing a larger story? If any question lacks a clean answer, the deal is PASS."

  <div class="article-body">
    <article class="prose">

      <p>In the Vedanta tradition, <em>maya</em> is one of the most consequential concepts in the entire philosophical canon. It is usually translated as "illusion" — but that translation flattens it. Maya is not a simple illusion, the way a magic trick is an illusion. Maya is the tendency of apparent reality to present itself as something more solid, more permanent, more real than it actually is.</p>

      <p>The canonical example is mistaking a rope for a snake in dim light. The snake is not there. But the fear response is genuine. The energy spent running from it is real energy, gone. The cost of the illusion is paid in full even though the snake never existed.</p>

      <p>I have evaluated hundreds of investment opportunities. The majority of them are ropes.</p>

      <p>They look like snakes — the market size, the momentum, the urgency, the social proof from other investors who are also running from ropes. The pitch deck is compelling. The founder is credible. The macro thesis is defensible. And yet: the capital will not come back, the timeline will not hold, and the exit will not exist in the form you were shown. Not because anyone lied. Because maya is not deception. It is the structural tendency of certain kinds of opportunities to appear more real than they are.</p>

      <p>The Maya Framework is my systematic answer to this problem.</p>

      <h2>Where It Came From</h2>

      <p>I spent twelve years operating my family's natural gas vertical, from 2010 through 2022. That was the worst sustained environment for gas prices in a generation — Henry Hub trading between two and four dollars per MMBtu for most of that stretch, with no institutional enthusiasm, no narrative tailwind, no conference circuit celebrating what we were doing.</p>

      <p>What that period taught me, more than anything, was the difference between <strong>real productive capacity</strong> and <strong>financial engineering masquerading as value</strong>. In a distressed operating environment, there is nowhere to hide. The metrics that matter are ruthlessly concrete: cost per unit produced, timeline to cash flow, who controls the offtake, what happens if prices stay flat for another three years. You cannot pitch your way through a bad year in natural gas. You either have real value or you don't.</p>

      <p>When I transitioned into broader investment management, I found a world organized almost entirely around maya. Venture capital rewarded narratives about addressable markets. Private equity rewarded financial structures that made mediocre businesses look like good ones. Family office advisors rewarded the appearance of sophistication. And almost none of it asked the questions I had been trained to ask by twelve years of operating with no margin for error.</p>

      <p>So I built the framework I needed. I named it after the problem it solves.</p>

      <h2>The Five Questions</h2>

      <p>Every deal I evaluate — real estate, energy, technology, anything — passes through the same five questions before anything else happens. These are not scoring criteria. They are gates. Fail any one of them and the answer is PASS, regardless of how compelling everything else looks.</p>

      <div class="framework-box">
        <div class="framework-box-title">The Maya Framework — Five Gates</div>
        <div class="framework-item">
          <div class="framework-num">1</div>
          <div>
            <div class="framework-question">Is the capital requirement under $5M?</div>
            <div class="framework-note">Not the total project cost — the capital I need to deploy to control the opportunity and reach the value event. Deals that require more than $5M to get to a provable thesis are, by definition, outside the risk profile of patient capital. The number is not arbitrary — it reflects the scale at which I can operate with full conviction and without dependency on co-investors whose timeline may diverge from mine.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-item">
          <div class="framework-num">2</div>
          <div>
            <div class="framework-question">Is the timeline to value realization under 18 months?</div>
            <div class="framework-note">Not the exit — the value event. The moment at which the thesis is either proven or disproven, at which the asset has either moved in the direction anticipated or made clear that it won't. Longer timelines are not disqualifying in principle, but they require a different kind of capital — and they are where most maya hides. A 36-month timeline is a hypothesis, not a commitment.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-item">
          <div class="framework-num">3</div>
          <div>
            <div class="framework-question">What is the political risk?</div>
            <div class="framework-note">Does this deal depend on regulatory goodwill, political stability, or administrative discretion that can shift without warning? Fire zone properties in LA require clean answers about permit timelines and city planning posture. Oil and gas assets in certain basins require honest assessment of state-level regulatory risk. If the deal only works if a specific political environment holds, that is not a deal — it is a bet on governance.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-item">
          <div class="framework-num">4</div>
          <div>
            <div class="framework-question">What is the regulatory complexity?</div>
            <div class="framework-note">How many approval layers, permits, environmental reviews, or compliance obligations stand between entry and value realization? Each one is a delay. Each delay is carrying cost. Each carrying cost is an assumption built into the underwriting. The more regulatory complexity, the more optimistic the underwriting has to be to make the numbers work — and optimistic underwriting is maya.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="framework-item">
          <div class="framework-num">5</div>
          <div>
            <div class="framework-question">What is the exit?</div>
            <div class="framework-note">Not the hypothetical exit. The concrete exit. Who buys this asset, at what price, under what conditions, and what evidence exists that this buyer class exists and is active? An exit that depends on a future buyer believing a larger story than you believe right now is not an exit. It is the transfer of maya from your balance sheet to someone else's.</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>How It Runs</h2>

      <p>The framework operates as a triage pipeline. Every signal — every property, every deal, every opportunity that comes across my desk — gets screened against these five questions before it receives any analytical attention. The output is one of three designations: <strong>PURSUE</strong>, <strong>WATCH</strong>, or <strong>PASS</strong>.</p>

      <p>PASS happens immediately when any gate fails. There is no partial credit. A deal with a spectacular exit and a five-year timeline is a PASS. A deal with a $3M capital requirement and a completely unclear regulatory path is a PASS. The discipline of the framework lives in the refusal to make exceptions for compelling surface features.</p>

      <p>WATCH is for deals that pass all five gates but lack sufficient information to move to full diligence. These go into an enrichment queue — specific data gaps get identified, specific research gets assigned, and the deal comes back for re-evaluation when those gaps are filled.</p>

      <p>PURSUE is for deals that pass all five gates cleanly, where sufficient information exists to warrant full diligence. These get an investment committee memo, a site visit, and real analytical attention.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The discipline of the framework lives in the refusal to make exceptions for compelling surface features.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What It Catches</h2>

      <p>The most common thing the Maya Framework catches is timeline maya — opportunities where the projected timeline to value is technically possible but requires everything to go right, in sequence, without delays, in a domain where things rarely go right in sequence without delays. Real estate entitlement is the canonical example. Permit timelines are estimates. City planning departments have backlogs. Environmental reviews expand. A 14-month entitlement becomes 26 months becomes carrying cost that the underwriting never contemplated.</p>

      <p>The second most common is exit maya — the assumption that a buyer will exist at the price and timing required by the model. This is where venture capital concentrates most of its maya. The exit is always a future event where a future buyer pays a future price for a future version of the business. None of these are knowable. All of them are modeled with more precision than they deserve.</p>

      <p>The third is regulatory maya — the belief that approval processes will proceed on the applicant's preferred timeline rather than the regulator's actual timeline. In fire zone work in Southern California, this is a constant. The city of Los Angeles issues permits on its schedule. The Maya Framework demands honest answers about what that schedule actually looks like — not what the broker's pro forma assumes it looks like.</p>

      <h2>What It Doesn't Catch</h2>

      <p>The framework is not a substitute for operator quality assessment. A deal that passes all five gates can still fail because the person executing it lacks the capability or the integrity to see it through. The Maya Framework screens for structural soundness. Human judgment still has to screen for human quality.</p>

      <p>It also does not catch black swans — the genuinely unpredictable events that restructure entire markets. The 2025 Los Angeles fires were not predictable from a desk in 2023. What the framework does is ensure that when unpredictable events happen, your capital is not concentrated in deals that were structurally weak before the event made them worse.</p>

      <h2>The Deeper Point</h2>

      <p>The Maya Framework is not just an investment tool. It is a way of relating to the entire category of opportunity that presents itself with urgency, social proof, and narrative momentum — and demands that you act before you have had time to ask the five questions.</p>

      <p>Most bad investments are made in that gap. The deal that was too good to miss. The founder who needed an answer by Friday. The market that was closing its window. All of that urgency is manufactured. The window is not closing. The opportunity will either survive five questions or it won't, and if it won't, then it was never the opportunity it appeared to be.</p>

      <p>Sanskrit has a name for what you were looking at. Now you have a system for recognizing it before you write the check.</p>
