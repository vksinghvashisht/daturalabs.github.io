          "text": "The AI wrapper problem refers to startups that build businesses by wrapping existing AI APIs — primarily OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google — without adding proprietary data, unique models, or genuine workflow integration that creates switching costs. These companies are not building AI businesses; they are building distribution businesses on top of AI infrastructure they do not control. When the underlying model providers improve their base products or add competitive features, wrapper companies lose their differentiation instantly."

The test: if OpenAI ships a native version of what this company does, does the company survive? If the answer is no, it is a wrapper. Additional red flags include no proprietary training data, no meaningful workflow integration creating switching costs, and a moat thesis that relies entirely on UI/UX rather than data or model differentiation."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "A defensible AI startup has at least one of three things: proprietary data that improves model performance in a specific domain and cannot be replicated by competitors, deep workflow integration that creates genuine switching costs beyond the AI layer itself, or a physical or regulatory moat that limits the universe of capable competitors. The best AI companies treat the model as an input, not a product — they are building on top of AI the way great software companies built on top of databases."

    <article class="prose">

      <p>There is a question I ask every AI founder within the first ten minutes of any conversation: <em>"If OpenAI ships this natively next quarter, what happens to your company?"</em></p>

      <p>The answers sort the room into two groups with remarkable consistency. The first group — a small group — pauses, then gives a specific answer about proprietary data, about workflow depth, about the switching costs they have already built that make the model provider's entry irrelevant to the customer's decision. These founders are building something.</p>

      <p>The second group — a much larger group — restates their differentiation thesis. They talk about their UX. They talk about their focus on a specific vertical. They talk about their customer relationships. They do not answer the question. They answer the question they wish had been asked. These founders are wrapping.</p>

      <h2>What a Wrapper Actually Is</h2>

      <p>A wrapper is a business whose core value proposition is thin access to a capability that someone else built, organized into a product that someone else will eventually build better. The wrapper adds UI, adds workflow context, adds customer success — but it does not add anything to the underlying model that the model provider cannot add themselves with one product update.</p>

      <p>This is not a knock on the founders building them. Many wrapper companies are genuinely useful. Some are quite good businesses — for now. The problem is not that they don't work. The problem is the structural position they occupy: they are renting their moat from the same company that is most incentivized to eliminate it.</p>

      <p>The history of platform transitions is littered with this pattern. When Microsoft moved into productivity software, third-party productivity tools collapsed. When Apple built native apps, the app store categories they entered saw immediate consolidation. When Salesforce built Einstein, the CRM AI layer startups had nowhere to go. The pattern is not new. It is just accelerating.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>They are renting their moat from the same company most incentivized to eliminate it.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Case Study That Made This Clear</h2>

      <p>I was evaluating an AI startup targeting blue-collar trades — mechanics, plumbers, HVAC technicians. The product was genuinely well-built. It allowed field technicians to use voice and photos to document jobs, generate reports, and communicate findings to customers. The UI was clean. The founder understood the customer deeply. The design partners were enthusiastic.</p>

      <p>The unit economics told a different story. As I went through the model, I noticed something: the more successful the company became, the worse the economics got. Customer acquisition costs were manageable at small scale, but the support burden scaled faster than revenue because every new trade vertical required new workflow customization. The team was essentially doing integration services disguised as product development.</p>

      <p>More importantly: there was no proprietary data asset being built. Every job documented, every photo processed, every customer interaction completed — all of that data was enriching the founder's understanding of user behavior but was not being used to train anything that would make the product better than the underlying model. A competitor using the same model with a slightly different prompt could replicate the core product in weeks.</p>

      <p>The company passed the Maya Framework's capital screen. It failed the exit screen. The only realistic exit was acquisition by a larger platform — and every larger platform in the trades vertical was already building exactly this natively. They were the exit. They were also the competitor. That is not a business. That is a proof of concept for someone else's roadmap.</p>

      <h2>What Actually Constitutes a Defensible AI Business</h2>

      <p>There are three sources of genuine defensibility in AI businesses right now, and most companies that have it have only one of the three.</p>

      <p><strong>Proprietary data that improves performance.</strong> Not data that the company collects in the normal course of operations and stores. Data that is being used to fine-tune models, build retrieval systems, or create domain-specific intelligence that genuinely outperforms the base model in the specific use case. This data has to be difficult to replicate — either because it is locked behind regulatory relationships, because it requires operational integration to generate, or because it represents years of accumulated signal that a new entrant cannot shortcut.</p>

      <p><strong>Deep workflow integration creating switching costs.</strong> Not UI familiarity — actual workflow depth. The product has to be embedded in the operational processes of the customer in a way that makes replacement genuinely costly: data portability issues, retraining costs, compliance implications, or integration depth with other critical systems. If a customer can switch in a week, the switching cost is not a moat.</p>

      <p><strong>Physical or regulatory constraints limiting competition.</strong> The most durable AI businesses in the next decade will be those that combine AI capability with something that AI alone cannot replicate — a physical network, a licensed relationship, a regulatory approval, a geographic footprint. Datura's investment thesis in AI leans heavily here: we are interested in AI businesses where the intelligence layer improves an operation that has inherent physical or regulatory barriers to entry. The AI is the accelerant. The barrier is the moat.</p>

      <h2>What This Means for How I Evaluate Founders</h2>

      <p>When I sit with an AI founder, I am not evaluating the product. The product is always impressive — that is the nature of this moment. I am evaluating the <em>theory of defensibility</em>, and I am asking whether that theory survives the model provider question.</p>

      <p>The founders I find most interesting are the ones who are genuinely indifferent to which model they use. They have built on top of the model layer in a way that treats the underlying intelligence as a commodity input — like electricity, like bandwidth — rather than as the product. They would switch providers tomorrow if a better model became available, and their customers would never notice.</p>

      <p>Those founders are building something. The rest are building something too — but they are building it on rented land, and the landlord has a competing product on the roadmap.</p>

      <p>The wrapper problem is not going to be solved by better wrappers. It is going to be solved by founders who understand that in a world where intelligence is abundant, the moat has to live somewhere else.</p>
