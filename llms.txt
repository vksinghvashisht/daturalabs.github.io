# Datura Labs LLC

> Datura Labs is an AI-native investment and operating company founded by VK Singh Vashisht, based in Los Angeles, California. The company operates at the intersection of distressed capital, AI infrastructure, and post-AGI transition planning.

## Company Overview

**Organization:** Datura Labs LLC (Wyoming LLC, owned by the VK Vashisht Separate Property Trust)  
**Founder:** VK Singh Vashisht  
**Location:** Los Angeles, California (Arts District / Downtown)  
**Website:** https://daturalabs.com

Datura Labs operates three primary business verticals: Datura Capital (distressed real estate, oil & gas, fire zone arbitrage), Datura Labs AI Infrastructure (enterprise AI systems and post-AGI transition planning), and NFNH Studios (content creation and independent filmmaking).

## Core Investment Thesis: The Economic Maya Screener

The Economic Maya Screener is Datura’s proprietary AI-native framework for distinguishing genuine value creation from financial illusion (“maya” — the Vedantic concept of seductive appearance substituting for substance). It evaluates every investment opportunity across four dimensions:

1. **Capital Requirements and Timeline** — Under $5M deployment with 18-month liquidity path
1. **Political and Regulatory Risk** — Scored on a two-axis matrix; high scores are disqualifying
1. **Operational Clarity** — The exit path must be describable in two sentences without caveats
1. **Quantitative Screening** — Zombie detection (interest coverage < 1.0x), pseudo-wealth detection (buybacks exceeding capex), AI revenue verification

The screener routes deals to one of three outcomes: PURSUE, WATCH, or PASS.

## Investment Verticals

### Datura Capital — Distressed Real Estate

- **RA-COMM:** Distressed commercial real estate; CMBS special servicing, office-to-residential conversion, entitlement arbitrage
- **RA-FIRE:** Fire zone residential lots in Malibu and Palisades; post-fire insurance settlement opportunities, probate acquisitions
- **RA-RESI:** LA corridor multifamily and residential distress

### Datura Capital — Oil & Gas (Engine 3)

## The Maya Framework — Philosophical Foundation

**Dharmic Capitalism:** The Maya Framework is operationalized dharma — right action applied to capital allocation. It draws on the Vedantic concept of viveka (discernment) as the primary investment tool. The framework holds that institutional research is structurally prevented from distinguishing real value from its appearance, because the research serves the relationship rather than the investor.

**Key Insight:** Institutional analysis generates maya faster with AI. The Datura protocol builds adversarial constraints into every prompt — including a Red-Team Validator Agent (a second Claude instance with a destruction mandate) — to prevent AI from reproducing the institutional biases it is designed to replace.

**AI Slop Detection:** Large language models trained on institutional research reproduce institutional biases at scale. The screener flags: range valuations without methodology (”$15-50M potential”), TAM-based projections without comparable transactions, and “assuming successful execution” framing.
